Changes in version: plink_1.3-1

Bug Fixes:

  o The value for D in {mixed} defaulted to 1 even when the 
    argument was changed

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.3-0

Bug Fixes:

  o The scoring function for {equate} accidentally defaulted to
    2 instead of 1.

  o True score equating using the graded response model returned
    an error.


Added Functionality:

  o Least squares estimation added for the ODL, MIN, and LL methods
    for multidimensional linking. This can be specified by setting
    the argument {method="LS"}. When dilation="ODL" this uses the 
    oblique procrustes rotation and returns the same results previously
    returned by method="RM". In previous versions, the MIN and LL
    methods could only be used with the characteristic curve methods.
    The "LS" method is the now the default estimation approach
    for multidimensional linking given that the results are more
    stable than with the characteristic curve methods.

  o Argument {items} added to drm, grm, gpcm, nrm, mcm, and mixed
    that allows probabilities to be computed for a subset of items


Misc:

  o The default dilation for multidimensional linking was changed 
    from "MIN" to "LL". This is because the LL method is technically
    the only method that produces a symmetric transformation.

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-7

Bug Fixes:

  o The function read.multilog returned an error when the items are
    modeled using a combination of the 2PL and 3PL. 

  o The read.ltm function returned an error when trying to import
    mixed-format item parameters estimated using grm or gpcm

Misc:

  o The sep.pars function was changed to allow individuals to specify
    grm and gpcm items with only two response categories. 

  o The group names for the object returned by drm, grm, gpcm, nrm,
    mcm, and mixed defaults to the group names for the irt.pars object

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-6

Bug Fixes:

  o The function read.multilog did not import item parameters properly
     when certain polynomial contrasts were specified. 

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-5

Bug Fixes:

  o When no starting values were specified when linking Rasch items, the
    characteristic curve estimation would crash. 

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-4

  o A vignette was added which explains unidimensional linking with plink

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-3

Bug Fixes:

  o Multidimensional item and ability parameters were not properly
    rescaled with more than two groups when not all dimensions are 
    common

  o The get.prob function was not automatically loaded with the package


Added Functionality:

  o Function read.erm added to allow item parameters to be
    imported from the eRm package

  o Argument {save.hist} added to the plot functions. In previous versions
    any plot history was eliminated prior to producing new plots. The
    new default is to not delete any plot history


Changed Functionality:

  o The startvals argument for plink can now be specified as
    a list so that different starting values can be used for 
    different pairs of tests

  o The default argument for {dilation} in plink changed to "MIN"


Misc:

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-2

Bug Fixes:

  o The creation of an irt.pars object for multiple groups when
    there are location parameters in one or more sets of items
    was returning an error

  o The specification of explicit scoring weights in plink
    and equate when there are multiple groups could return an
    error

  o No ability descriptives were printed when using the
    summary function when there are multiple groups


Added Functionality:

  o Function get.prob added to extract expected
    probabilities from irt.prob objects


Misc:

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-1

  Changed Arguments:

  o The mn.exclude argument in the plink function has been
    replaced with a more general argument exclude that allows
    common items associated with any response model, or specific
    items, to be excluded when estimating the linking constants 


  Added Functionality:

  o The plink function now allows NRM and MCM items to be used
    for the Stocking-Lord method (note: caution should be taken
    when using these models because TCCs are not adequately defined
    unless the parameters correspond to ordered categories)

  o The MCM can now be used for true-score and observed score equating


  Plotting:

  o Item numbers can now be plotted on the drift plots
    for the parameter comparisons

  o ICCs and TCCs can now be plotted as part of the drift argument

  o An argument drift.sd has been added to change the size of the
    confidence region for the parameter comparison plots

  o The comparison plots now use the SD line rather than the 
    45 degree line


  Misc:

  o Summary function now prints descriptive statistics for 
    rescaled ability estimates when summarizing the output
    from plink (if applicable)

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.2-0

  o Function equate added for conducting IRT
    true score and observed score equating

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.1-6

  Bug Fixes:

  o Upper and lower bounds for the estimates for the characteristic curve
    methods were removed because they have the potential to result in inaccurate
    estimates when there are three or more groups

  o The specification of different weights for different pairs of groups
    now works properly


  Misc:

  o A warning message was added to the Reckase-Martineau approach
    when the rotation matrix is not positive definite

  o Group name labels added to plots for multiple groups

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

    being optimized for the multidimensional characteristic curve methods

  o Fix for the separation of multidimensional NRM and multidimensional
    MCM item parameters in the sep.pars function

  o Plot function includes additional arguments - drift, groups, 
    grp.names, and sep.mod (see the documentation for more info)

  
  Misc:

  o Updates to the class definition for irt.prob. This class now includes
    a slot for scaling constants D

  o Additional validation checks (and error comments) have been added
    to the irt.pars class and sep.pars class

  o All of the source code now includes extensive comments

  o Some corrections/additions to the .Rd files

==============================

Changes in version: plink_1.1-4

  o Fix in plink for scenarios where there is only a single polytomous
    item corresponding for a given model


  Changed Arguments:

  o The default value for the as.irt.pars argument for the functions
    read.bilog, read.parscale, read.multilog, read.testfact, read.icl
    read.bmirt, and read.ltm was changed to TRUE

  o The default value for D in the functions drm, gpcm, and grm was
