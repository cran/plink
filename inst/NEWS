Changes in version: plink_1.0-0

  This is a major version change. All of the unidimensional item response
  models and linking methods have been extended to the multidimensional case.
  Arguments have been added to various functions that are relevant for the 
  multidimensional extensions.

  Item Response Models:

  o Probabilities can now be computed for the following multidimensional models
	- M1PL
	- M2PL 
	- M3PL 
	- MD graded response model
	- MD partial credit model
    	- MD generalized partial credit model
	- MD nominal response model
    	- MD multiple-choice model (this model has not been formally introduced
    	  in the literature)

  o An argument {dimensions} has been added to all the functions that estimate 
    response probabilities

  Linking Methods: 

  o The following multidimensional linking methods have been added
	- Reckase-Martineau
      - MD Haebara
      - MD Stocking-Lord

  o For the MD Haebara and MD Stocking-Lord methods there are three dilation options
      - Oshima-Davey-Lee (estimate all elements of the rotation matrix)
	- Li-Lissitz (orthogonal rotation with single dilation parameter)
	- Min (orthogonal rotation with multiple dilation parameters)

  Plots:
  
  o Multidimensional surface plots (and conditional surface plots when there 
  are more than two dimensions) can be created

  o Vector plots for two-dimensional items can be created

  o Argument added for selecting a subset of items 

  Misc:

  o Function read.testfact added for importing item/ability parameters from TESTFACT

  o An argument {method} has been added to the link.con function so the
    linking constants for specific methods can be extraced

  o The as.weight function has been simplified and adjusted to compute
    weights for multiple dimensions

  o The display of summary information now has a cleaner look

  o All of the .Rd files have been updated to reflect the above changes
