Description: Item response theory based methods are used to compute
        linking constants and conduct chain linking of unidimensional
        or multidimensional tests for multiple groups under a common
        item design.  The unidimensional methods include the Mean/Mean,
        Mean/Sigma, Haebara, and Stocking-Lord methods for dichotomous
        (1PL, 2PL and 3PL) and/or polytomous (graded response, partial
        credit/generalized partial credit, nominal, and multiple-choice
        model) items.  The multidimensional methods include the least
        squares method and extensions of the Haebara and Stocking-Lord
        method using single or multiple dilation parameters for
        multidimensional extensions of all the unidimensional
        dichotomous and polytomous item response models.  The package
        also includes functions for importing item and/or ability
        parameters from common IRT software, conducting IRT true score
        and observed score equating, and plotting item response
        curves/surfaces, vector plots, information plots, and comparison 
        plots for examining parameter drift.
